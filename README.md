# Node Classification with classical GNNs models using PyGeometric

### This project consists of implementing the basics of three GNNs models(models.py):

    1- graph convolutional networks(GCN)
    2- Inductive Representation Learning on LargeGraphs(GraphSAGE)
    3- graph attention networks(GAT)

### For node Classification on citation datasets(Planetoid)(datasets.py):
    1- Cora
    2- CiteSeer
    3- PubMed

#### It includes training and testing(train_test.py) and also visualizes the final embedding and losses(visualization.py).
